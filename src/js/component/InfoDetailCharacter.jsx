                Was a legendary Jedi Master who fought in the Galactic Civil War
                during the reign of the Galactic Empire. Along with his
                companions, Princess Leia Organa and General Han Solo, Skywalker
                served as a revolutionary on the side of the Alliance to Restore
                the Republicâ€”an organization committed to the downfall of the
                Galactic Empire and the restoration of democracy. Following the
                war, Skywalker became a living legend, and was remembered as one
                of the greatest Jedi in galactic history.
